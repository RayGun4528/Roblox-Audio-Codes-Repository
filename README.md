**Note:** Unfortunately, due to Roblox and its new Asset Privacy for audio changes (https://devforum.roblox.com/t/action-needed-upcoming-changes-to-asset-privacy-for-audio/1701697), most of the music listed here doesn't work anymore, although most of the sound effects should still work (I haven't tested however). As a result, I decided to archive this repository. It's been fun, but I want to move on to other projects. Maybe I will restart this project, but don't expect that to happen

# Roblox-Audio-Codes-Repository
A list of Roblox Audio IDs I've collected over a while now, feel free to use this (just be warned some of these may be **copyrighted**)

Also this list may not be updated daily (or in a while, who knows) so I guess be patient
